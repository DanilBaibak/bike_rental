# Predict bike sharing

## Overview
The solution for machine learning competition for prediction bike rental demand using historical usage patterns with 
weather data in the Capital Bikeshare program in Washington, D.C.
For building prediction model, I used ensemble from RandomForest and XGBoost. The pretty simple solution let you achieve 0.43195 
on the public leaderboard.

## Installation
For installation please use [conda](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/index.html). Just run:
```sh
make init
```
After the installation was done successfully, activate your enviroment:

```
> For using **conda** and **environments**, 
please read full documentation of [conda](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/index.html).
